Here's an explanation of the provided Python code:

1. `def generate_strings(characters, current_string=""):`: This line defines a function called `generate_strings` that takes two arguments: `characters` and `current_string`, with `current_string` having a default value of an empty string.

2. `if len(current_string) == len(characters):`: This is a condition that checks if the length of the `current_string` is equal to the length of the `characters` string. When they are equal, it means we have formed a complete permutation of characters, and we print the `current_string`.

3. `print(current_string)`: This line prints the `current_string`, which represents a valid permutation of characters.

4. `return`: After printing the `current_string`, the function returns to its previous level of recursion.

5. `for char in characters:`: This is a loop that iterates through each character in the `characters` string.

6. `if char not in current_string:`: This condition checks if the character `char` is not already in the `current_string`. This check ensures that we don't use the same character more than once in each permutation.

7. `generate_strings(characters, current_string + char)`: If the character `char` is not in the `current_string`, the function is called recursively with the updated `current_string` that includes the current character. This is how the permutations are built. The function continues to call itself with different combinations until it has generated all possible permutations.

8. `if __name__ == "__main__":`: This block checks if the Python script is being run directly (not imported as a module in another script).

9. `characters = "catdog"`: This line defines the string of characters from which you want to generate permutations.

10. `generate_strings(characters)`: This line calls the `generate_strings` function with the `characters` string as an argument to start the permutation generation process.

In summary, the `generate_strings` function recursively generates all possible permutations of the characters in the `characters` string while ensuring that each character is used exactly once. The generated permutations are printed to the console. When you run this program, it will print all possible strings formed by using the characters 'c', 'a', 't', 'd', 'o', and 'g' exactly once.
